What is it?
    This is a minimal proxyServer written in Python to test what I learned from Computer Networking from Kurose and Ross. 
    It was not based on their skeleton, I thought of it myself. 
    
    I also divided the functions minimally, just enough to have clarity on the parts.
    
    It handles one connection at a time and implements the GET method, stores locally pages visited before. I only handle the simplest case, a URL in the format www.example.com/file.extension
    

Next Future Steps:
    1. Make it multithread
    2. Exit gracefully
    3. Use https
    4. Treat other url formats
    
How to test it?
    1. If you want to test in the same machine, you need to run: > python3 proxyServer.py 
    2. Then you can call > curl http://localhost:8888/www.example.com/index.html
    I've used port 8888, that's why we see it here
